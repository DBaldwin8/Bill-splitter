# BILL SPLITTER APP

This is a Vite + React and tailwind project. I was given a design to follow.
There was no plan shown for the custom tip button, I decided to make it a modal as I had not done one before. 
I also chose to make the button update with the entered percentage.

The bill splitter is designed to take a bill amount, tip% and number of people and dynamically display the tip ammount and total seperately per person.

This project was following learning React. Displaying use of:
Components,
useState,
useEffect.
React Modal
Tailwind.

To do:
Make the app responsive.
Add favicon.
Deploy to GitHub Pages.
